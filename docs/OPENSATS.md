# OpenSats

This project is funded by an [OpenSats](https://opensats.org) grant, announced in the [Fifteenth Wave of Bitcoin Grants](https://opensats.org/blog/fifteenth-wave-of-bitcoin-grants) (December 2025).

We are grateful to OpenSats and its donors for supporting open-source Bitcoin infrastructure. This grant enables us to build a solid foundation for LaWallet NWC -- from testing and security to the SDK, dashboards, and deployment tooling outlined in our [ROADMAP](./ROADMAP.md).
