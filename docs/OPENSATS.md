# OpenSats

This project is funded by an [OpenSats](https://opensats.org) grant, announced in the [Fifteenth Wave of Bitcoin Grants](https://opensats.org/blog/fifteenth-wave-of-bitcoin-grants) (December 2025).

We are grateful to OpenSats and its donors for supporting open-source Bitcoin infrastructure. This grant enables us to build a solid foundation for LaWallet NWC -- from testing and security to the SDK, dashboards, and deployment tooling outlined in our [roadmap](./ROADMAP.md).

## Progress Reports

OpenSats progress reports are submitted periodically to document milestones, challenges, and outcomes.

### Guidelines

An ideal progress report:

- Written in Markdown, 1-3 pages
- Enriched with links to pull requests, commits, and other work produced
- Brief summary per section before additional details
- States whether the project is on track
- Describes challenges and how they were overcome
- Includes whether you are pleased or displeased with progress
- Shows clear connection between what was planned and the work done

Reports should openly discuss any obstacles that prevented reaching milestones, and/or why plans changed. OpenSats is there to help, not to judge.

A poor progress report is hard to read, missing context, or is only a long list of links without explanation.
